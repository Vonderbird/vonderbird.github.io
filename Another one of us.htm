<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>''I don't want to live
like this anymore. I want my life to end.' Rebecca whispered to the doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Ah' Rebecca, Don't we
all?' The Doctor Answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'I didn't' before this'
Rebecca answered, shocked by the doctor's response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'You sure?' The Doctor
asks with clear signs of doubt on his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca sighs and puts a
bitter smile on her face: 'In my life' well, I made many many bad decisions in
my life'Simon, Not knowing myself, abandoning my family, twice' Bad decisions
and I were like peanut butter and jelly. I was always an underachiever; I never
had a purpose. I just did things because I had to do them. What is a human
being without things to do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I remember playing a game
back in my childhood. I don't remember the name, but it ended with the main
character saying: no matter what, you keep finding something to fight for. My
life wasn't any short of a war either. I was always dependent on someone else,
and I didn't want to be. But' I couldn't. And when I finally became
independent, I couldn't handle myself. So, I started making bad decisions. Some
good people were thrown in my way by God I guess, but I kicked them all away.
Sometimes people started loving me, but then they got to know me better, and
they found out that they just loved the person I loved to be. Not the true me.
I was nothing but another worthless piece of shit. Like many others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, yeah, I wanted to die
before too. But even that was to put on a show, to make people notice I exist.
Putting myself in other people's shoes, why should I care for a person like me.
Well now that I'm dying it wouldn't matter if I tell you. I wasn't a lesbian.
You can say I was bi, but I always enjoyed men. I just said I'm a lesbian to
find an excuse to break up with Simon. I thought that it was the easiest way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I worked doc' I worked hard.
I tried music, drawing, digital art, writing, interior home design, and many
other things that I don't even remember' but none of them paid off. This' I
just wanted to be noticed.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca continues:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Poor Vanessa really was
a lesbian, but me' No' I just wanted to get away from Simon' And I pushed
Vanessa away from myself too.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca keeps talking but
her voice fades in the doctor's ears. All he thinks about now is that is he
another Rebecca or all the lives he saved was worth something?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Did he ever save anyone
or he just took his 32 work shifts a month and earned the money he wanted to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He glances at the steel
knife on the table as Rebecca is telling all her secrets to the last person she
might ever see in her life. Someone who doesn't care about her. All the doctor
thinks about is the reflection of the full moon on the steel knife and wishing
that he was a werewolf. However, Rebecca won't stop telling him everything
about her life. She always was an introvert but you start talking in your death
bed even if you are a mute! What would she do with those secrets? Take them
with herself to an afterlife she doesn't even believe exists? Or does she?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well let me tell you
another thing; In death bed, even atheists, even nihilists, want to convince
themselves that they are wrong, that this is not the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So did Rebecca. In the
past month at Saint-Denis Hospital, Rebecca found faith, found God, and found
all the holy in the world, because she found out that she had AIDS.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The doctor doesn't know
that this exact moment will cause him to get cancer, but he knows that this
world isn't worth holding himself from smoking a cigarette that his co-worker
left on his desk. He can imagine himself lying on the bed, telling the whole
story of his life to another doctor. He knows that one day, he will be another
Rebecca. He has seen many Rebeccas as a doctor. He breaks his '1 year clean
from smoking' record and clicks his zippo open. He had his zippo on his shelf
for a year as a sign of being a smoker and quitting. He didn't know that his
symbol of quitting will make him start all over again. Just like he doesn't
know yet that the knife that he saved many lives with, will be the knife that
he will cut his wrists with and take his own life. The bright orange light of
the zippo fades the reflection of the moon on the knife. The only reflection on
the knife now, is the tip of the doctor's cigarette' burning, the tobacco, and
his lungs. But he is not looking at it. He is staring at the smoke he blows out
of his mouth which gets sucked out of the room by the room's advanced room
control system. Technology has come a very long way over the last 40 years. He
knows it and he hates it. He remembers the game Rebecca was talking about very
well. It was called 'The Last of Us'. It was 2013, and his older brother used
to play it every day. It's been 40 years from the moment that The Last of Us
ended with 'No matter what, you keep finding something to fight for.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He forgot this sentence
but Rebecca made him remember again. He felt good remembering the ending of one
of the best games of his life' and one of the best years of his life. However,
The Doctor said nothing to Rebecca because he is an introvert as well. This was
Rebecca's moment and he didn't want to ruin it by talking about his memories
with The Last of Us. He thought that his moment will come one day too. He will
talk about 'The last of Us' when HE is the one lying on the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But he doesn't know that
he will die alone with no one but himself by his side. He will die alone as his
eyes fade out on the full moon reflecting over his blood on the floor, wishing
he was a werewolf one last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That is another 14 years
from now. Now all he wishes is that it was 2013 again and he could watch his
older brother play The Last of Us, or just watch his older brother at all once
again. He misses his brother so much. His brother always wanted to see him in
the doctors' white cloth. He is wearing one every day, which makes his heart
break into a million pieces every time. The fact that he is now a doctor, but
his brother isn't there to see him in the clothes is killing him. Literally
killing him. He started smoking after his brother died in a car accident
seventeen years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He doesn't know that he
was not his real brother and was adopted by his family before he was born. He
will never know that. But maybe he would have missed him less if he knew, maybe
not. At the time being, his family thought not knowing this would make him love
his brother more. What they didn't know back then, was that love doesn't always
bring happiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He knows that it will
never be 2013 again so he changes his wish and wishes that his cigarette
doesn't end too soon. The cigarette that would be the cause of his cancer and
the cancer that would be the cause of his suicide. He never knows what he
wishes for. He never will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Just deep inside, he
still believes that his wishes might come true. He will die believing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'So yes' I have thought
about dying before, but I never REALLY wanted it. I REALLY want it now.'
Rebecca ends her audience-less speech with this sentence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The doctor says to
himself: 'No you don't. But you soon will.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He says to Rebecca: 'I
think you deserve to know something.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca: 'Don't worry, I
won't tell anyone.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She laughs but her
laughter turns to coughs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Doctor: 'Your partner,
Vanessa, ' She passed away last week. She also had AIDS. In fact, she had AIDS
before you. She didn't know that when she was with you of course, but you got
AIDS from her. Oh, and some days ago, your ex-husband called. He wanted to know
how you are holding up. I asked him to come over. His HIV test came out
negative.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca is stunned by the
news she just received. She closes her eyes and tries to remember the last good
memory she had with Simon. She always saw Simon as an evil man who tried to
control her life, but now he sees him differently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She remembers the last
time they went to a mountain top. It was foggy or maybe it wasn't' She doesn't
remember. She doesn't even remember Simon's face back then. Did he have his
beard back then or did he grew it the year after that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But she vividly remembers
him holding her hand and helping her up. Back then she saw Simon's hand as a
forceful hand of a careless man controlling her life, but now she sees it as
the hand of a man who was trying to help her climb up the cliff she couldn't
climb herself. She also remembers the song he sang while they were climbing:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'So close your eyes on
Hushabye Mountain,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Wave goodbye to cares of
the day,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And watch your boat from
Hushabye Mountain</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sail far away from
Lullaby Bay.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Everything has now
changed in her eyes in just a single minute. The evil man she made out of Simon
crushes and burns, and from its ashes rises a man who tolerated her and, in the
end, let go of her, because he wanted her to be happy, yet he never stopped
caring for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>All the things she
imagined of him, she sees now that were just her picture of Simon and not the
real Simon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Simon was not an evil
man. He always cared for me.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But this also is a
picture of Simon in Rebecca's head.' She never will know who Simon really was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca instantly pulls
the blame off her own shoulders. She has a new person to accuse. Vanessa! She
was the person who tricked her into being a lesbian. She made her hate his
husband. She made her leave his husband. And most importantly, she gave her
AIDS.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Vanessa is evil!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She will never know
Vanessa either. She will never know the real person behind that lesbian evil.
She will never see the struggling girl, abandoned by her friends and family,
who finally thought had found peace with Rebecca. But after feeling that
Rebecca is not really into her and is just pretending, tried to find another
person to fall in love with, but in the end, found nothing but AIDS and a
broken heart. Unlike Rebecca, Vanessa was only seeking someone who could love
her for the person she was. Rebecca will never know that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>All Rebecca can say to
the doctor is: 'Thanks for letting me know. I can't see Simon anymore. I can't
look into his eyes. But' But tell him''</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca doesn't know what
the doctor should tell Simon on her behalf. Yet she wants Simon to know that
she thinks he is a good man. Even now, she seeks Simon's attention. Knowing
that Simon is a good guy, won't come free for Simon. Simon must pay her back with
his attention. The attention she will never know of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Tell him I'm sorry'
Rebecca responds after a long pause.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'I will Rebecca, I will.
Now take your pills and get some rest.' The Doctor answers after a nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Why do you waste your
pills on a dying woman?' Rebecca tells the doctor in despair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The doctor smiles and
replies: 'Because you paid for it.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca feels the pills
moving slowly down her throat. A sip of water she drinks helps the pills to
move faster. Now she can feel the coldness of water pouring down her hips from
the inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Rebecca, wake up.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca slowly opens her
eyes. The place she sees looks nothing like the room she slept in last night.
The room is bright, the walls are orange and white, the color she always wanted
her room to be, and there are orchids near her window. There were no windows in
her room at the hospital.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'What is all this?...
Where am I?' Rebecca asks the mysterious voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'You are in heaven, my
child.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca's ears scream
right before all the voices in her head stop for a brief moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She is happy that all
this is over, but somehow, she feels hollow that she is not on earth anymore.
That she is not alive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That's how people are.
She would have even missed hell if she was in hell for that long. When people
belong, it's hard for them to pull free.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca looks at her
hands. She sees two beautiful young hands. Her hands weren't like this the last
time she saw them. She believes this is heaven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She wants to say 'Do I
deserve heaven?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>but she is afraid that
there might be a mistake and they send her to hell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She says: 'Am I here
forever?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'This is your eternity.
You will get what you want. You will have what you want. This place is all you
want.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca examines the
whole place. As she watches it get bigger and bigger. The calming combination
of orange and white, sweet breeze of the spring wind, and Vanessa impaled and
screaming as she burns make her feel very good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>After she is done
enjoying hate and vengeance, she starts thinking of all the things she wants to
do in heaven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She wants to sing, so
there's a stage right in front of her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>People gather around and
watch her sing. They love her charming voice and cheer for her nonstop. Her
voice feels like butter melting on a perfect piece of toast. She can feel the
melted butter pouring down her ears. She can't believe this is her voice. She
is amazed. But most importantly, she is getting the attention she was always
missing back on earth. And she is getting it for doing what she loves doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She thinks that she will

line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She was a movie star for
a while. She was a musician, a pop star, a writer, she was even a video game
designer. She made all the games she wanted to make back when she was a kid.
But now she is tired. Eternity is boring. She wants to leave. She doesn't want
to have everything by just wanting it. She wants to try and succeed. She thinks
heaven is some kind of a charity. If she wants one thing now, it is for this
heaven to be over. She can go into an endless void now. She doesn't care.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca has gone mad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?'
Rebecca yells.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'STOP' I DON'T WANT THIS
ANYMORE.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I WANT THIS TO END.' She
continues yelling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon: 'What did you do?
Why is she crying? WHY IS SHE SCREAMING?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'They all get tired at
some point. That's part of the procedure.' The doctor replies as he closes the
door, muting Rebecca's screams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'It took her longer than
we expected. Most of them do not last this long. She had so much to do.' Doctor
continues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'What did you do to her,
you little fuck?' Simon asks the Doctor as his hands are shaking in anger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon grabs the doctor by
the collar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He tightens the doctor's
stethoscope around his neck. Doctor grunts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'I will kill you right
here man. What the fuck did you do to her?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The doctor struggles to
answer but Simon pulling the stethoscope around his neck won't let his voice
leave his throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Doctor taps on his
throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon lets go off the
doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For a minute, the
doctor's eyes go black. He can only see blinking dots in the darkness he is
trapped inside. He sits on the floor, inhales deeply, and then exhales. He can
see again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon has very beautiful
shoes. That is the first thing the doctor sees after his blackout. He always
wanted a pair of shoes like this. His wife bought him a pair six years ago, but
he could never wear it. The hospital didn't allow them. He sold the shoes
online to a guy he didn't know. He does not know that Simon's co-worker bought
the shoes from him for Simon's birthday. He is looking at his own shoes. He
envies Simon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon breathes for a
while. He thinks he is calm now. So, he asks again, with a lower tone: 'What
did you do to her?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The Doctor answers: 'I
made her happy. Isn't that what you wanted? Isn't that what you paid us to do?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon is a short-tempered
guy. He yells again: 'DOES SHE LOOK''</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He notices his own anger
immediately and takes a deep breath. He then repeats his sentence calmly: 'Does
she look happy to you?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'She will be when you
talk to her.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'What should I tell
her?... What did you do to her man?' Simon is confused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'I sent her to heaven.
Well, most of them call it heaven. I sent her somewhere she wanted to be.
That's how the pills work. That's what you paid us to give her. They manipulate
the mind into imagining everything the way they want them to be. It also
manipulates the concept of time for them. She has been there for over four
hundred years. It has been 12 days for us, of course. Everything for her is the
way her brain wants everything to be. So, it doesn't matter what you tell her.
She will hear what she wants to hear. We take away the pain from our patients
in a way no one else can. They experience the heaven they always wanted for as
long as they want, they live their final days happily'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And finally, they grow
tired of it. They grow tired of having it all. That's when they REALLY want to
die. And that's' when we pull the plug on them, and their one final wish come
true.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The doctor was talking as
he was staring at Simon's shoes. A drop of water falls on Simon's shoe. He
looks up and sees Simon crying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He continues: 'You wanted
her to be happy in her final days. She was happier than any of us can ever be.
That's what she wants now. She is happy that it will all end. We made her death
a happy one. Isn't that what you wanted? For her to be happy? She is happy now.
All she wants now is a happy death.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Door clicks open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon enters the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca stares at Simon.
She is stunned: 'Simon? Is that you? Are you dead too?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The doctor is amazed.
Before this, no one on the 'Heaven drugs' ever saw anyone as they really were.
They always see someone else. Someone their brains want to see. A celebrity
most of the times. Never, never the person they literally see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon was what Rebecca's
brain wanted to see. And there he was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But it was too late. She
had wasted her life, and her eternity without him. Someone who truly loved her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon answers: 'No
darling; I'm not dead. You are not dead, either.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'That's too sad to hear.
How did you die?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca answers. She
wants to hear that Simon is in heaven too. And that's what she hears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca continues:
'Heaven is not good Simon. You should not stay here. You should take me with
yourself out of here. Heaven is boring. I don't have any purpose. I am more
worthless than I was back on earth. I don't want it anymore.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon starts crying
again. He takes one last look at the love of his life:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Why do I always have to
do the hard part, Rebecca?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Oh Simon, I did many
things' I was a Pop Star''</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon moves to the plug
and puts his hand on it. He waits for Rebecca to finish telling him about her
heaven. He listens carefully with a beautiful bitter smile on his lips covered
with tears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He pulls the plug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rebecca closes her eyes
for the last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon holds Rebecca in
her arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>His teardrops fall on the
knife that will one day take the doctor's life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The love he had, have,
and will always have for Rebecca flashes in his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>'Why did it have to end
like this?' That's all Simon can think of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon does not know that
his story is yet too far from being over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He will end up sleeping
right where he is now holding what remains of his love in his arms. Just like
Rebecca, he too will take the pills, although he knows it is nothing but his
imagination. The pills will make him forget that fact. Just like Rebecca, he
too will end up being nothing but flesh, and the remaining of all his memories.
He won't be as lucky as Rebecca. He will die with a nurse pulling the plug on
him. His brain will picture the nurse as Rebecca. But no one will hold his body
in her arms after he dies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He won't be as lucky as
Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Simon will live long
enough to laugh at what he used to call 'purpose'.</span></p>
